# AC-Arduino_Candle
## Description
	It's simple program, which shine two diodes, what looks like candle or fireplace.
## Before compilation
	Default pins are defined for deigispark pro, but you can change it for pins valid for any microcontroller (for example Arduino UNO), which must support PWM  by change number for constant number:
```
	#define led1 1
	#define led2 4
```
## compile
	If you want to compile and upload program to microcontroller you must use <a href="https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360019833020-Download-and-install-Arduino-IDE">Arduino IDE</a>. Example of how to build hardware and how it works you can find <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/things/hqk8nxkjzNl">here</a>. Bellow you can see example of hardware.
